最近觉得很多事情都是有限的，时间和金钱自不必说，精力更是有限的，健康其实是不健康之间的间隙而已。

> 寄蜉蝣于天地，渺沧海之一粟。

苏轼对这一题的解法真好，先是进一步

> 客亦知夫水与月乎？逝者如斯，而未尝往也；盈虚者如彼，而卒莫消长也。盖将自其变者而观之，则天地曾不能以一瞬；自其不变者而观之，则物与我皆无尽也，而又何羡乎！

把自己自比于长江于皓月，是何等的豪迈！

然后又退一步

> 且夫天地之间，物各有主，苟非吾之所有，虽一毫而莫取。惟江上之清风，与山间之明月，耳得之而为声，目遇之而成色，取之无禁，用之不竭。是造物者之无尽藏也，而吾与子之所共适。

小确幸鼻祖。

Lately I’ve been feeling that most things in life are finite—
Time and money, obviously.
But energy, even more so.
And health?
Maybe it’s just the space between bouts of illness.

“Like mayflies in the vast sky,
A single grain in the boundless sea.”

Su Shi had such a brilliant answer to this question of limits.
First, he takes a step forward—expanding outward:

“Have you ever truly considered the water and the moon?
They seem to pass, yet never truly go;
They wax and wane, yet never truly change.
Seen from the perspective of change,
Even heaven and earth cannot last a single moment.
But from the perspective of constancy,
All things—including you and me—are endless.
So what is there to envy?”

To compare oneself to the Yangtze River and the moon—what grandeur!

Then he takes a step back—returning inward:

“Everything in the world has its rightful owner.
If it is not mine, I will not take even a speck of it.
But the breeze over the river, the moonlight in the mountains—
The ear hears them as sound, the eye sees them as light.
No one can forbid their taking,
And their use never runs out.
They are the inexhaustible treasures of creation—
Meant for you and me to enjoy together.”

The original little joys philosopher.
