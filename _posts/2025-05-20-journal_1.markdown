开始了一个100天博客的挑战，我觉得我也可以试试。倒不是非要连续100天发，甚至也不想设一个期限，总之有就发，多小的事，只要是有意思就都可以发。

前几天偶然在b站看到一个回忆童年动画片歌曲的视频。今天早晨只有我一个人在bm[1]，不自觉地就开始边做test边小声唱起《猴哥》。

“哪里有难都想你/哪里有险都有哥/身经百战打头阵、惩恶扬善心如佛。”更震撼的是最后一句，“扫清天下浊~~”（拖长音）。

虽然身为本家，但是我小时候对孙悟空并没有什么特别的感情。上周末过生日的时候，我许的愿是维持现状就好。总之不管是小时候还是现在，好像都没有没有心怀天下过。

猴哥你真了不得！只可惜我做不到你的万分之一，但是能踏踏实实过好日子也挺好。

[1] bm是我办公室的一个lab。我估计如果经常更新日常的小事，类似的背景介绍还是必要的，因为读者并不全部了解我的生活，太多的缩写和简称会影响可读性。但同时在正文解释这些无关紧要的细节又会显得冗余，所以不如以脚注的形式出现。


以及我觉得可以放一个chatgpt的翻译版本，为走向国际做出准备：

I saw that cbvivi started a 100-day blogging challenge, and I thought maybe I could give it a try too. Not that I have to post for 100 days straight, or even set a deadline—I'll just post whenever I have something. No matter how small, as long as it's interesting, it's worth sharing.

A few days ago, I randomly came across a video on Bilibili that played theme songs from childhood cartoons. This morning, I was the only one in the BM¹ lab, and without thinking, I started softly singing “Monkey Brother” while doing a test.

“Wherever there’s trouble, I think of you / Wherever there’s danger, there’s my bro / Always charging ahead, battling evil, with a heart as kind as a Buddha.” But the line that really hit me was the last one: “Sweep away all the world’s filth.”

Even though I share the same surname, I never felt a strong connection to Sun Wukong as a kid. On my birthday last weekend, I wished for things to just stay the same. Whether when I was little or now, it seems I’ve never really carried the weight of the world on my shoulders.

Monkey Bro, you’re seriously amazing! I know I’m not even one ten-thousandth of what you are, but just living my life steadily and peacefully is pretty great too.
