去年攀岩有一个明确的目标，就是年内爬上十条v5。当时心态调整得很好，平常就v3v4，等哪天状态好了，或者遇到一条简单的，就试试v5，说不定就成了。
最后差不多以每个月一两条的速度，在年底超额完成了这个目标。

到了今年，我确信自己是不可能在一年之内爬上v6的，所以年初给自己定了个新目标，是确保能爬上岩馆的所有v4。（为什么不是爬上更多v5呢？我现在也会想不起来为什么了）。
结果这个目标带来的驱动力明显不如去年的，我也更加急功近利，水平一直卡在v4也带不来什么热情。
再加上冬天一起爬墙的伙伴都去滑雪了，结果我突然对攀岩失去了兴趣，冻结了membership。

我爱好本来就没几个，不去攀岩这几个月生活其实更平淡了，加上上个月附近又开了一家新岩馆，所以最近又重新开始复健了。

不过士别三日，别说v5了，我现在连v4爬得都费劲。所以还是处在不温不火的状态，每周也就去一次，主要目的是别让membership吃灰。

另外最近还重新开始玩喷喷了。我在switch上除了两作塞尔达之外玩得最多的游戏就是喷喷，2和3都买了。
最近switch 2上性能提升，而且官宣了新内容，再加上我蹭上了朋友的switch online，所以就又开始愉快开喷了哈哈。

（我发现我真的很重视逻辑！每件事情的前因后果都要解释清楚）

传统射击游戏给人的感觉都是冷酷干脆的，玩家扮演的都是杀手。但是喷喷不一样，大家奋力涂地、往对方身上扔颜料的时候，感觉就像小区里在疯玩的小学生。
这种简单的快乐让我很乐在其中（也可能是因为我现在还太菜，脑袋里完全没有技巧和战术）。

比起攀岩，复健喷喷可容易太多了，毕竟游戏设计出来就是要通过奖励机制来实现正反馈的嘛。这时候我要做的不是要找到驱动力，相反是要防沉迷了。

差不多就这样，水水的一篇。爱攀岩！爱喷喷！

Last year, I had a clear goal for climbing: to send ten V5s before the year ended.
My mindset was in a good place — I mostly climbed V3s and V4s, and only tried V5s when I was feeling good or came across one that looked doable.
Surprisingly, that worked! I ended up reaching (and even exceeding) my goal by the end of the year, climbing about one or two V5s a month.

This year, I was pretty sure that I wouldn’t be able to level up to V6 within a year, so I set a new goal instead: to send all the V4s at my gym.
(Why not aim for more V5s? Honestly, I don’t even remember anymore.)
But the truth is, this goal hasn’t been nearly as motivating. I got more impatient, progress stalled at V4, and I wasn’t really enjoying it anymore.
On top of that, my climbing buddies all ditched me for ski season — so I slowly lost interest and ended up freezing my membership.

I don’t have that many hobbies to begin with, so life definitely got a bit more boring in the months I wasn’t climbing.
But then a new gym opened nearby last month, and that gave me a small push to start again — rehab mode.

That said… it’s been a while. Forget V5s — even V4s feel tough right now.
So I’m just easing back in, going once a week mostly just to make sure my membership doesn’t go to waste.

On a different note — I also got back into Splatoon!
Besides the two Zelda games, Splatoon 2 and 3 are what I’ve spent the most time playing on my Switch.
Now that the Switch 2 is officially announced with better performance and new Splatoon content, 
and I also happen to be piggybacking off a friend’s Switch Online account… I’m joyfully back to inking the turf again, haha.

(I’ve realized I’m someone who really values logic — I always feel the need to explain the “why” behind everything.)

Most shooting games give off this cold, ruthless vibe — you’re basically playing as a killer.
But Splatoon is different. It feels more like a bunch of wild elementary schoolers running around the neighborhood, splashing each other with paint.
There’s something so pure and fun about it. (Or maybe that’s just because I suck and don’t have the brain space yet for real tactics.)

Compared to climbing, getting back into Splatoon has been way easier.
Games are literally designed to give you constant rewards and positive feedback — the challenge isn’t staying motivated, it’s stopping myself from getting addicted.

That’s about it for now — a low-effort update.
Love climbing! Love Splatoon!
