今天听了一期播客，我觉得大受启发！主旨其实很简答，就是研究表明，只要心率上去，即使一分钟的运动也对健康有益。

以此为契机，我觉得可以在日常打工生活里穿插更多这种微小的锻炼，这里可以梳理一下，作为一个计划。

- 早晨起来做十分钟瑜伽

- 早餐尽量多吃

- 早上做中午的饭

- 到办公室第一件事就是先打水，全天也是每次休息都去打水，顺便远眺一下

- 我的工位在6楼，lab在1楼和2楼，我决定以后尽量都走楼梯，不坐电梯了

- 其实我每天上午十一点就饿了，不如带点酸奶或者水果去吃

- 午饭之前找个空房间做五分钟拉伸和俯卧撑什么的，播客里说这样可以有效降低血糖峰值(在办公室放个弹力绳）

- 午饭不吃碳水

- 午饭之后下去散步一圈。所以饭前还得偷偷摸摸去涂防晒

- 其实无聊的时候/压力大的时候还是会忍不住刷手机，感觉这一条无解

- 两三点吃第二顿午饭

- 下午四点根据晚上开会的情况计划晚上干什么，避免吃完晚饭瘫在沙发上

- 晚饭前举铁一小时

- 晚饭也多吃，总之目前一天蛋白质的目标是140g

- 我现在其实每天晚上11点睡觉，有时候能睡到8点，所以其实应该缩减一下才对，早上早起点

- 睡前点眼药水...

其实好多条我现在就已经是这么做了，所以很值得鼓励！希望我今年下半年能更健康，年底体重至少得突破165lbs/75kg吧。

I listened to a podcast today and felt so inspired! The core idea was actually super simple: research shows that even just one minute of exercise is good for your health — as long as it gets your heart rate up.

So I thought, why not start adding more of these little micro-workouts into my daily work routine? Here’s a rough plan, mostly just to help myself organize:

- Do 10 minutes of yoga in the morning

- Eat a proper breakfast — ideally with more food

- Cook lunch in the morning

- First thing after getting to the office: go get water. And take every break as a chance to refill and stare out the window for a bit

- My desk is on the 6th floor and the labs are on 1 and 2 — from now on, I’ll take the stairs instead of the elevator

- I usually get hungry around 11 a.m., so I’ll start bringing some yogurt or fruit

- Right before lunch, find an empty room and do a quick 5-minute stretch or some push-ups. The podcast said this helps lower blood sugar spikes. (Maybe I’ll stash a resistance band in the office too)

- Cut out carbs at lunch

- After lunch, go outside for a short walk — which means I’ll need to sneak in some sunscreen beforehand

- I still catch myself doomscrolling when I get bored, right now don't have a clear solution for this

- Around 2 or 3 p.m., eat a second lunch/snack

- Around 4 p.m., depending on how many meetings I have at night, make a plan so I don’t end up just collapsing on the couch after dinner

- Lift weights for an hour before dinner

- Eat a proper dinner too — right now my protein goal is 140g a day

Honestly, I already do a lot of these things, so this is more about being consistent and intentional.
Hoping I can be a little healthier in the second half of the year — and finally break 165 lbs (75 kg) by the end!
