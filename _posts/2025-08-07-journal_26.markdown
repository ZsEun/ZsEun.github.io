笑死我又开始发泄负面情绪了。

OutsideLands是三番的一个音乐节，因为我很喜欢的一个乐队今年要来，所以我几个月前就买好票了。

好巧不巧这周我有点小感冒，每天的状态起起伏伏的。
周三的症状尤其严重，所以就想着把周五的票出掉。

在小红书上发了帖子。原价是每张240，当时我并不知道官网门票其实并没有售罄，所以还准备原价出。（甚至善良的我一开始就没想过要加价卖）

结果我发出去，有人联系我，我说原价出，对面回了一句“哦原价算了 官网也可以原价”。我才知道现在官网也还可以买。但是话有必要说这么直白吗，此为第一次觉得有点膈应。

我一时不知道该怎么回，其实陌生人都说到这份上了也没必要回了吧，但是我还是回了个“哦哦”。

而且点开这个人的主页，她也有一条帖子，是在“求”门票，还用了双手合十的那个emoji。我的内心小剧场又开始了，所以你就是放低姿态，但其实就是想占便宜呗。

后面又来一人，我说220，他回“没事儿 算了”，“我想150收的”，“算了”。

我在想我是不是太天真了呢。喜欢的乐队要来演出了，查出票时间准点买票，从来没想过要临时收低价票。
而其他有些人，这只不过是一次可去可不去的消遣罢了，要是临时能捡漏就去嗨一下，不行也无所谓。
这种我视作珍宝，但是你如弃敝履的感觉让我很受伤。

从另一个角度来讲，我不是说二手交易的时候不能讨价还价，我自己作为买家的时候当然也会觉得太贵，想要还一下价。但是我还是抹不开脸，会觉得这么直白的回复很不尊重对方。

从最后的结果来看，并没有人接受220的报价，我收到的回复大概能分成三类。
最有礼貌的一种，是说“不好意思 超出预算”，只有一个人这么回。
绝大多数人都选择直接不回复。
而我觉得最冒犯的一种，就是上面说的这两个人，一开始会放低姿态来“求”，一旦事情没有按照他们的想法发展，就立马抛弃，临走还不忘踩你一脚。

事情最后的结局是，周三晚上我觉得心塞到不行，身体也不舒服。结果周四早晨一觉醒来竟然好了一大半，于是决定也不卖了，周五我就是要去，跟你们这些想捡漏的斗争到底，哼！

Here I am again, venting my negative emotions.

Outside Lands is a music festival here in SF, and one of my favorite bands is playing this year.
I bought my ticket months ago, right when sales opened.

Then, I caught a mild cold this week, and my energy’s been up and down every day.
Wednesday was especially bad, so I thought, maybe I should sell my Friday ticket.

I posted on Xiaohongshu.
The ticket’s $240 face value, and at the time I didn’t realize the official site still had tickets available.
So I listed it for face value (yes, kind-hearted me didn’t even consider reselling for a higher price).

Soon someone messaged me. I said I was selling at face value, and she replied:
“Oh, face value? Never mind, the official site still has tickets at that price.”
That’s how I learned they weren’t sold out.
But… did she have to say it like that?
That was the first time I felt a little “ugh” in this process.

I didn’t know how to respond. Honestly, with a stranger saying that, there was no real need to reply — but I still sent a “ohhh.” with a OK emoji.

Then I clicked on her profile and saw a post where she was “begging for” tickets, complete with the 🙏 emoji.
Cue my internal drama: so you put on a humble, pleading act, but in reality you just wanted a bargain?

Later, someone else reached out. I said $220. They replied, “Nah, it’s fine,” followed by “I wanted to get it for $150,” then again, “Never mind.”

It made me wonder — am I too naïve?
When a band I love comes to town, I check the sale date, buy my ticket on time, and never once think about waiting to 
score a last-minute discount.
Meanwhile, for some people, this is just a “maybe I’ll go, maybe I won’t” kind of thing — a casual night out.
If they can get a cheap ticket last minute, great; if not, no big deal.
What I see as a treasure, they treat like an old shoe — and yes, it stings a little.

To be clear, I’m not saying you can’t bargain in second-hand sales.
I’ve been a buyer too, and I’ve wanted to negotiate when something felt overpriced.
But I could never be so blunt — it feels disrespectful.

From the responses I got, they pretty much fell into three categories:
The most polite: “Sorry, that’s out of my budget.” Only one person said this.
The majority: no reply at all.
The most annoying: the ones like above — acting humble at first, but the moment things don’t go their way, 
they drop you instantly, and not without getting a little dig in before leaving.

In the end?
By Wednesday night I was feeling both physically crappy and emotionally drained.
But then Thursday morning, I woke up and — surprise — felt much better.
So I decided not to sell after all.

On Friday, I was going to that festival no matter what.
And I was going to enjoy it — just to spite all those bargain-hunters. Hmph.
