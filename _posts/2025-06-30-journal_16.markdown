大概是因为今天周一，即使我没什么要紧的dealine，早晨还是焦虑到不行。
加上这周五就是独立日假期，好多同事都已经请假了，我也逃跑心态作祟，后悔没有早早请假。

所以说，即使是循规蹈矩地上班，也是需要勇气的。面对堆积成山的工作，就像一头扎进冰冷的湖水里一样。

第二个发现，高三时我就跟老师说了不去学校上晚自习，因为不喜欢扎堆在教室里面。
现在我也不喜欢坐着工位上上班，觉得同事动不动就抛给我一个idea，很打扰我的思路。

祝我早日晋升L8，这样就能拥有独立办公室了。

Maybe it’s just because it’s Monday, but even without any urgent deadlines, I’ve been feeling super anxious since the morning.
And with the Fourth of July holiday coming up this Friday, a bunch of coworkers have already taken time off.
I’m definitely in escapist mode — kind of regretting not putting in a vacation request earlier.

Honestly, even just showing up to work and sticking to the routine takes courage sometimes.
Facing a mountain of tasks feels like diving headfirst into a freezing lake.

Second realization: back in senior year of high school, I told my teacher I didn’t want to stay for evening self-study — 
I just couldn’t stand being crammed in a classroom with everyone else.
Now, I feel the same way about working at a desk in an open office.
Colleagues constantly throwing random ideas at me out of nowhere totally disrupts my flow.

Manifesting that L8 promotion soon — so I can finally have my own office.
