上周六第一次去学了kpop跳舞，一个半小时学了Alcohol free的副歌。今天收到了课程结束时拍的视频，大概得看了有五十次了吧。

（不过是和一起上课的陌生人一起拍的，为了尊重别人的隐私就不在这放了）

传给经常在朋友圈po跳舞视频的朋友看，就像我

里讲的那样，分享交流这种生活里不带功利的小确幸真的让我很开心。

而且又看到twice全员续约的新闻。

就是去年去Vegas看twice，现在第一次去学跳舞也是。
听她们的歌总是很开心，这就是idol的力量吧。祝愿她们能长长久久地唱下去。

Last Saturday, I took my first-ever K-pop dance class.
We spent an hour and a half learning the chorus of Alcohol-Free — and today I got the video they filmed at the end of class.
I’ve probably watched it for at least fifty times by now.

(I was dancing with strangers from the class, so out of respect for their privacy, I won’t post it here.)

I sent it to a friend who often shares dance videos on her Moments.
Like I mentioned in the previous post, there’s something so special about sharing these little joyful, non-productive moments of life.
It really makes me happy.

Also just saw the news that all the members of TWICE have renewed their contracts.
My very first concert was seeing TWICE in Vegas last year, and now my first dance class happened to be learning one of their songs.
Their music always lifts my mood — that’s the power of idols, I guess.
Wishing them many more years of performing ahead.
