今天听了新一期的bbffmf，又是巨好笑，所以就来推荐一下。这个播客有两个主播，十六和跌倒凯，内容就是他们的日常分享。
一般每期开头他们都会用“我是xxx的十六”，“我是xxx的跌倒凯”来做自我介绍，这里的xxx可以是他们最近做的事、迷恋的东西、产生的想法，以此为出发点展开这一集的故事。

他们两个其实也是youtuber，我第一次看他们的影片[1]是讨论以《旅行的意义》的传唱度，这首歌算不算是他们那个世代的台湾国歌。不知道为什么我立马就被他们影片的无厘头主题和疯癫的剪辑迷住了。
一个个镜头快速地一闪而过，大脑来不及思考就迎来下一个高潮，让我想起小时候那种没心没肺的快乐。

后来他们两个开始更新播客，节奏又明显慢下来。可能是因为播客这个媒介能带来更强的陪伴感，他们会花很长时间事无巨细地聊生活里的小事，这又让我觉得仿佛我也是他们的朋友，在跟他们一起玩一样。

写到这里我才意识到他们真的很擅长讲故事，这挺让我羡慕的。

按照我的粗暴理解，《人类简史》里说，学会了讲故事，人类才能进步。所以我的脑子进化了几十亿年，不是为了一早起来就能处理三四十封邮件，而是为了能讲好一个故事，表达自己的情感啊。
希望通过每天更新博客，我也能重拾这个能力。（老中人干啥都得找点意义）

[1]讲台湾人的事情都会不自觉用台湾腔，不说“视频”，说“影片”

---

Today I listened to the latest episode of bbffmf—once again, absolutely hilarious—so I wanted to recommend it here. The podcast has two hosts, 十六 and 跌倒凯, and it’s basically just them sharing bits of their daily lives.

Each episode usually starts with them introducing themselves like “I’m 十六 who xxx” and “I’m 跌倒凯 who xxx,” where “xxx” is something they’ve been doing lately, obsessed with, or just some random thought they had. That little intro often leads into the story for the episode.

They’re actually YouTubers too. The first video I saw from them was a discussion on how widely known the song The Meaning of Travel is, and whether it could be considered the national anthem of their generation in Taiwan. I don’t even know why, but I was instantly hooked by the absurd themes and chaotic editing.

The scenes flash by so fast your brain doesn’t even have time to catch up before the next peak hits - it reminded me of that carefree, silly kind of joy I used to feel as a kid.

When they switched to podcasting, the pace clearly slowed down. Maybe because the podcast naturally brings more of a sense of companionship. They’ll go into all sorts of tiny daily details, and it makes me feel like I’m one of their friends just hanging out with them.

Writing this made me realize — they’re actually really good storytellers, and I’m honestly kind of envious of that.

In my oversimplified understanding, Sapiens said that storytelling is what allowed humans to advance. So after billions of years of brain evolution, I wasn't built to wake up and process 30–40 emails first thing in the morning—my brain was made to tell stories and express emotions.

Hopefully, by updating this blog daily, I can slowly regain that skill too. (Chinese people always gotta find some deeper meaning in whatever they do...)
