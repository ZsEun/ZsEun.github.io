今天去三番看了Lage Gaga的巡演，Mayhem ball。用一句话概括就是，
世界顶级的艺术家在她职业生涯巅峰与自己对话的一场表演。

虽然之前就已经看过Gaga在科切拉的表演，但是巡演加了更多曲目，舞美也有一些调整。
我觉得贯穿整场的是Gaga与自己的对话。在很多首歌里，舞台上都会有一位扮演gaga内心自我的舞者，
她们共同构成了这个era里完整的Gaga。

尤其是在唱Paparazzi的时候，巨大的白色裙摆布满了整个舞台，彩虹色的灯光打在裙子上，Gaga拄着拐，迎着风蹒跚着往前走。
除了对LGBT群体的支持，配合这首歌，我猜有一种历经风雨之后终见彩虹的感觉。
现在唱这首歌尤其契合当年的

和

表演。 

总之，太美了。

演唱会开始前，观众可以分享留言打在大屏幕上，很多人都在说这是dream come ture
（还有零星中文留言支持绿豆糕糕）。我也是这种感觉，整场演唱会都感觉像在梦里一样。
虽然我不是多年狂热的小怪兽，但是当年初高中时候在电视里看到美国有一个穿着出格的女明星，
怎么能想到她会成长为一个世界巨星，而我又能来看她的演唱会呢。

Today I went to see Lady Gaga’s Mayhem Ball tour in San Francisco.

If I had to sum it up in one sentence:
a world-class artist at the peak of her career, performing a conversation with herself.

I’d already seen Gaga’s Coachella set before, but the tour added more songs, and the stage design was reworked in some parts.
What really stood out to me was how the entire show felt like an ongoing dialogue between Gaga and her inner self.
In many songs, a dancer would appear on stage portraying Gaga’s inner voice — 
together, they formed a complete picture of who Gaga is in this era.

One moment that hit especially hard was Paparazzi.
Gaga stood center stage with a massive white gown that spread out to cover the entire floor, bathed in rainbow-colored lights.
She leaned on a cane, slowly walking into the wind, almost stumbling.
Of course, there’s the visual support for the LGBTQ+ community, but paired with this song, I felt it also represented something deeper — 
like finally seeing the rainbow after a storm.
It made me think of the original Paparazzi music video and her iconic VMA performance.
That journey from spectacle to self-awareness felt beautifully full circle.

It was just... stunning.

Before the show started, fans could submit messages to be displayed on the big screen.
So many of them said “dream come true” — and honestly, same.
(There were even a few scattered Chinese messages cheering for “Green Bean Cake Gaga” — adorable.)
Even though I wouldn’t call myself a longtime diehard Little Monster,
I still remember seeing Gaga on TV back in middle school — this wild, outrageous American pop star in her meat dresses and high-concept looks.
Who would’ve thought she’d grow into the global icon she is now…
and that one day I’d be sitting here, in the audience, watching her perform live?
