上周六在三番Roxie影院看了《饮食男女》和《花样年华》。虽然都不是第一次看，但依旧很享受。

我已经忘记《饮食男女》里有那么多笑点了。当然这也可能是自己一个人在家看和跟200个人一起在电影院看的区别，整场电影里观众不停地爆发出笑声。
这也是我最佩服李安的一点，把大家庭的分别这件悲伤的事包装得这么轻松。

另外这次我会更代入家倩的视角，九十年代的新女性，在职场上杀伐果断，在情场上收放自如，唯一能让她犹豫的就是家人。

《花样年华》的话，暗生的情愫真的太美了。

想起来上个月听过一个聊《花样年华》与刘以鬯的播客，可以放在这当作延申。

Last Saturday I watched Eat Drink Man Woman and In the Mood for Love at the Roxie in SF.
Even though it wasn’t my first time seeing either of them, I still really enjoyed it.

I had completely forgotten how funny Eat Drink Man Woman actually is.
Though maybe that’s the difference between watching it alone at home vs. sitting in a theater with 200 people — the whole room kept bursting into laughter.
That’s something I’ve always admired about Ang Lee: 
how he can wrap something as sad as the slow drifting apart of a family in a light, humorous package.

This time, I found myself relating more to Jia-Chien’s perspective — a modern woman of the '90s, sharp and decisive in her career, 
confident in love and sex, but the one thing that makes her hesitate is still family.

As for In the Mood for Love — that quiet, growing affection is just… so beautiful.

I remembered I listened to a podcast last month about In the Mood for Love and Liu Yichang, the author behind the original story. 
Might as well drop it here as a little extra.
