之后，昨天拖着微恙的病体去了Outside Lands，整体感觉很不错！

首先看了Vansire，一个来自明尼苏达的二人乐队，他们是我这次最开始想要买票的契机。当时还在密苏里上学的时候我就开始听他们的歌，旋律很有我们中西部广袤无边的感觉。
包括这次表演后面的大屏幕也一直在放开车的空镜头，游荡在在说荒不荒、说繁华又完全不繁华的地方，车窗外下着雪，或者洒满金色的夕阳，很契合他们的歌在我脑子里想象出的氛围。

Outside lands的几个舞台分布在golden gate park里面的几个小盆地里，想蹦迪的人就挤在舞台前，其他人就铺个毯子坐在后面和山坡上的草地里。
昨天南湾艳阳高照，但是海边的雾气弥漫，下午三四点的天气很舒服。

接着随着汹涌的人潮去看了Marina，我之前其实对她一无所知，但是我天她真的好强，而且好美。我们本来坐在山坡上，但是她一开唱大家都跳起来了。

然后回到主舞台看了Doechii，这时候真是锣鼓喧天鞭炮齐鸣人山人海了（没有红旗招展）。我们站在人群很后面，大概离舞台得有两三百米了，前面乌泱泱全是人。
Doechii也好强，本来电台里天天放她anxiety我都有点烦了，但是她一首接一首马不停蹄，屁股抖得都要呲出火花了，虽然我很少听rap，但还是佩服得五体投地。

八点多天黑了，主舞台最后压轴的是Doja cat，但是我真的get不到她。
首先她顶着复古黄毛爆炸假发，穿着斑马条纹紧身衣，包着一眼假的胸和屁股，整个形象让我觉得她已经四十了。（回来一查她跟我同岁😅）(与此同时Marina是真的40了，造型也是复古风格，整形那肯定是必然的，但是依旧艳光四射）

不过主办方是不是存心的啊，把两个女rapper背靠背安排在一起，很难让人不放在一起比较。不管是歌曲、舞蹈还是舞美，Doechii真的完全碾压了Doja cat。
再加上入夜之后寒风刺骨，所以听了二十分钟我们就走了。(世界上最冷的冬天就是三番的夏天!马克吐温诚不我欺)

等明年要是能捡漏到便宜票那我还来。

After my
<a href="https://zseun.github.io/life/2025/08/07/journal_26.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ticket-selling fail</a>,
I ended up dragging my slightly sick self to Outside Lands yesterday — and honestly, it was great.

First up was Vansire, a two-man band from Minnesota and the main reason I wanted to buy tickets in the first place.
I’ve been listening to them since my grad school days in Missouri — their melodies have that endless Midwestern openness to them.
Even their stage visuals matched: road trip shots rolling across the screen, 
driving through those “is it barren or is it bustling?” kind of places, 
with snow falling outside the window or everything glowing in golden sunset. 
Exactly the kind of vibe their music plays in my head.

The stages at Outside Lands are spread out across little valleys in Golden Gate Park — the rave crowd packs right up front, 
while others lay out blankets on the grass further back or up on the slopes.
While it was sunny and blazing hot down in the South Bay yesterday, the foggy ocean air here made the 4 PM weather perfect.

Next up, we joined the huge crowd heading over to see Marina.
I actually knew nothing about her beforehand — but wow. She’s powerful, gorgeous, and had everyone on their feet.
We were sitting on the slope at first, but as soon as she started singing, the whole hill jumped up.

Then we headed back to the main stage for Doechii.
At this point it was absolute mayhem — a literal sea of people.
We were so far back, probably 200–300 meters from the stage, but still completely surrounded by bodies.

Doechii was insane.
Honestly, I’d gotten kind of tired of hearing Anxiety on the radio over and over, but live? 
She went nonstop, one track after another, twerking like she was about to set off sparks.
I rarely listen to rap, but I have to give her full respect — she killed it.

By 8 PM it was dark, and the headliner on the main stage was Doja Cat.
But I really couldn’t get into her.
She came out in a vintage-style yellow afro wig, zebra-print bodysuit, and what looked like fake boobs and butt padding.
The whole vibe made me think she was in her forties (looked her up later — she’s my age 😅).
Meanwhile, Marina — who is actually 40 — also went for a retro style, obviously has had work done, but was still absolutely radiant.

Honestly, I feel like the organizers were stirring the pot by putting two female rappers back-to-back — 
it was impossible not to compare them.
And in every way — songs, dancing, stage design — Doechii totally outshone Doja Cat.
Once the night air turned freezing, we only lasted about 20 minutes into Doja Cat’s set before bailing.

If I can score cheap tickets next year, though? I’m definitely coming back.
