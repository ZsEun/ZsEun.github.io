突发奇想，用chatgpt模仿my little airport的风格写了一首歌词。不过改来改去，里面的内容大概也就10%是真实的吧
（上周末我们真的去了优胜美地，也的确聊了恐怖片）

那天我们在优胜美地/
每走五分钟就坐下休息/
你说这样永远爬不到山顶/
我说风景也不一定要看清

我们聊起恐怖片的标准
你说最吓人的不是鬼魂
是那些正常人做对了决定
却照样还是送命

比如《闪灵》真是吓人
本来有吃有住，又稳定
结果他疯了
拿起斧头砍亲人

我说《死神来了》就一般
里面的人总在无脑生气
一个个死掉也没人心酸
像是剧本太懒，没什么好看

我们继续往上爬
风很大，天很蓝
我笑说我总是停下来
是为了打乱死神的节拍
他本来安排我现在摔下山崖
结果我又蹲在石头旁边发呆

你说也许恐惧的本质
就是你以为自己很理智
但还是会死在熟悉的位置
浴室、电梯，或恋人的臂弯

风太大，我戴上帽子
你喝水时突然问我怕不怕鬼
我说怕的是
做了对的事，还是逃不过结尾

你说我们今天
应该是跌下去了吧？
我说死神太忙
先去追那些跑太快的人吧

I asked ChatGPT to write lyrics in the style of my little airport.
After tweaking it over and over, I think only about 10% of it is actually true.
(Though we did go to Yosemite last weekend, and we did talk about horror films.)

That day, we were in Yosemite
We sat down to rest every five minutes
You said we’d never reach the top like this
I said it is not necessary

We started talking about what makes horror films scary
You said it’s not the ghosts that frighten you the most
It’s when people do everything right
And still end up dying anyway

Like The Shining
There was food, shelter, and stability
Then he went mad
And took an axe to his own family

I said Final Destination was just okay
Everyone’s always angry for no reason
They die one by one
Feels like lazy writing, nothing much to see

We kept climbing
The wind was strong, the sky was blue
I joked that I kept stopping
To throw off the rhythm of the Grim Reaper
He probably planned for me to fall off the cliff right then
But I was too busy spacing out next to a rock

You said maybe the essence of fear
Is thinking you're being perfectly rational
But still ending up dead in a familiar place—
Your bathroom, an elevator, or a lover’s embrace

The wind picked up—I put on my hat
While drinking water, you suddenly asked, “Are you afraid of ghosts?”
I said what scares me
Is doing everything right and still not escaping the ending

You said, “Maybe today
we already fell, huh?”
I said, “Death’s too busy
chasing the ones who run too fast.”
