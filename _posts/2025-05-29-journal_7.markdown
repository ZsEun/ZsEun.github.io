最近刚看完这本书，如果想要了解故事梗概的话，可以听这两期播客：

小说里的人物通过在树上生活，逃离了他所厌恶的贵族生活繁文缛节，但同时他并没有逃避对家庭和对社会的责任。

我突然觉得住在树上这件事和现实中的出国很像。通过建立物理上的距离，我逃离了一些来自家庭和社会的束缚，但这并不表示我厌恶我的家庭、想要自绝于社会。
相反，我会按照自己的方式承担我认可的责任。

I just finished reading this book recently. If you’re interested in the plot summary, you can listen to these two podcast episodes.

In the novel, the character escapes the rigid rules and empty rituals of aristocratic life by choosing to live in the trees. 
But even as he distances himself from that world, he doesn’t turn his back on his responsibilities—to his family, or to society.

It suddenly struck me how similar living in the trees feels to the real-life experience of moving abroad. 
By creating physical distance, I’ve escaped some of the constraints imposed by family and society—but that doesn’t mean I resent my family, or want to sever ties with the world I came from.
On the contrary, I still want to take on the responsibilities I believe in—just in my own way.
